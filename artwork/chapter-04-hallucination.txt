Chapter 4: Hallucination / Konfabulering

An elderly woman (grandmother) sitting in a sunlit room, eyes closed, remembering. Around her head float dreamlike bubble-memories: a country meadow with buttercups, an old barn, a child on a bicycle. But some memories are slightly transparent, dissolving, wrong - a shop that shouldn't be there, details that don't quite fit. The real and imagined blend seamlessly. Soft, nostalgic color palette with touches of unreality. Magical realism style. Metaphor for false memories and confabulation. No text. Square format.
