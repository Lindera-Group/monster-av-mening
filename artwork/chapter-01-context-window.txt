Chapter 1: Context Window / Arbetsminnet

A cluttered wooden desk viewed from above, papers scattered everywhere. Some papers are falling off the edge into darkness below, disappearing. A warm desk lamp illuminates the center. The oldest papers at the edges are fading, becoming translucent, dissolving. One hand desperately tries to hold papers in place while new ones pile on. Warm amber and brown tones, soft shadows. Metaphor for limited working memory. Painterly illustration style, subtle texture, contemplative mood. No text. Square format for chapter opening.
