Chapter 2: Tokens / Lego för språk

A child's hands building with colorful LEGO bricks, constructing the shape of letters and words. Some bricks are large (common words), others are tiny fragments. A Swedish word is being assembled from mismatched small pieces while an English word nearby is made of perfect large bricks - visual metaphor for language inequality in tokenization. Soft natural light from a window. Warm, nostalgic childhood feeling. Shallow depth of field. Watercolor-meets-photography aesthetic. No text. Square format.
