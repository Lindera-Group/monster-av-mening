Modern minimalist book cover design. Two overlapping translucent circles - one digital blue with circuit patterns, one warm amber with fingerprint-like organic lines. Where they overlap: a glowing point of connection. Clean white background with subtle paper texture. Elegant negative space. Swedish design aesthetic - simple, refined, meaningful. Vertical 6x9 book format, title space at top. No text in image.
