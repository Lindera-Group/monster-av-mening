Conceptual book cover art: A bridge made of light connecting two worlds. On one side, geometric crystalline structures representing AI - precise, mathematical, luminous blue. On the other side, a warm landscape of rolling hills resembling brain folds, soft sunset colors, organic curves. A single figure walking across the bridge of understanding. Dreamy, philosophical mood. Scandinavian minimalism meets magical realism. Matte texture, subtle grain. Vertical format, space for title at top. No text.
