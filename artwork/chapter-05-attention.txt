Chapter 5: Attention / Fokus

An open book with text visible, but glowing threads of light connect certain words across the page - pronouns linking to names, verbs to subjects, references to their origins. The threads form a beautiful web of connections, some bright and strong, others faint. A person's silhouette reads the book, and similar light threads extend from their mind. Visual metaphor for how attention connects related concepts. Deep blue and gold color scheme. Ethereal, magical quality. No text. Square format.
