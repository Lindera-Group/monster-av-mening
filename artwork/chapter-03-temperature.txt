Chapter 3: Temperature / Risktagaren

A hotel breakfast buffet scene from the perspective of someone choosing. On the left: safe, familiar croissants in warm golden light. On the right: exotic, mysterious dishes in vibrant greens and reds, slightly out of focus, inviting but uncertain. A hand hovers between the two choices. The scene captures the moment of decision between safety and adventure. Morning light streaming through windows. Impressionistic style with rich colors. Metaphor for risk-taking in choices. No text. Square format.
