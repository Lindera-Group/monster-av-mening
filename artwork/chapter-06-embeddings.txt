Chapter 6: Embeddings / Tankens landskap

A vast, rolling landscape seen from above like a mental map. Hills and valleys represent conceptual space. Glowing points mark words as locations - "dog" and "puppy" are neighboring villages, "king" and "queen" are twin towers, "democracy" is a distant mountain. Dotted paths show relationships between concepts. The landscape feels both geographic and abstract, real and imagined. Soft watercolor washes, cartographic aesthetic mixed with dreamlike quality. Warm earth tones with luminous accents. No text. Square format.
