Book cover illustration, split composition showing transformation from machine to human understanding. Left side: abstract neural network patterns, glowing nodes and connections, digital circuits in cool blue tones. Right side: warm organic imagery - a human brain with gentle golden light, synapses firing like fireflies, soft watercolor textures. The two sides blend seamlessly in the center through a gradient of light. Minimalist Scandinavian design aesthetic, muted earth tones mixed with electric blue accents. Typography space at top for title. Elegant, intellectual, approachable. No text in image. High resolution, print quality, vertical book cover format 6x9 ratio.
