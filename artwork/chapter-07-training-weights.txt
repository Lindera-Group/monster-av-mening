Chapter 7: Training & Weights / Uppväxt

A child learning to ride a bicycle, captured in multiple exposure showing the progression: wobbly start, near-falls, gradual improvement, final confident riding. The early attempts are sketchy and translucent, the later ones more solid and defined. A parent's guiding hand fades as the child gains independence. Golden hour lighting, motion blur suggesting time passing. The feeling of hard-won skill becoming automatic. Warm, emotional, nostalgic. No text. Square format.
