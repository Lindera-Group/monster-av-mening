Chapter 8: Fine-tuning / Specialisten

A young doctor (Emma) in transition: on the left she wears general medical attire with a stethoscope, surrounded by broad medical symbols. On the right, the same person transforms into a heart surgeon, hands gloved, with detailed cardiac imagery behind her. The transformation happens through a glowing gradient in the middle. Her core knowledge remains (the skeleton of who she is), but new specialized layers are added. Professional yet warm lighting. Metaphor for specialization building on general knowledge. No text. Square format.
